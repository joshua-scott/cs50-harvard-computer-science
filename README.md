# What is this?
My first 'real' experience of programming was in 2015, through an online course called '<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a>', which is delivered by Harvard University through the edX learning platform. It's a fantastic introduction to the world of computer science, and "teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development".

Right now, the repository contains a few .c files; each one is a small program that corresponds to the Problem Sets which are completed during the course.
